All pieces were made the same size in this example

A basic chess game. For now to deselect a piece, you have to click on the piece again, I know it's tedious, but I'm too lazy to change it right now.
All rules are implemented except for en passant and some of the stalemate rules. Pawns also automatically promote to queens 

The main file is the game.py Please start there if you wanna see how this works.
